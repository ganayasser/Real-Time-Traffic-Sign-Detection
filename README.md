# Real-Time-Traffic-Sign-Detection
### This project utilizes the YOLOv8 model for real-time traffic sign detection, classification, and segmentation.
## **📁 About Dataset**

- **train/images/:** Directory containing training images.
- **train/labels/:** Directory containing annotation labels for the training images.
- **data.yaml:** Configuration file for the YOLOv8 training data.

## **🛠️ Getting Started**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and Jupyter installed. You can check your Python version with:

```bash
python --version
```
To install Jupyter, run:
```bash
pip install notebook
```
## **Installation**
### Install the required dependencies:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ganayasser/Real-Time-Traffic-Sign-Detection.git
    cd Real-Time-Traffic-Sign-Detection
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## 📝Running the Notebook
1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
2. Open the notebook file Real-Time-Traffic-Sign-Detection.ipynb from the Jupyter interface.

3. Run the cells to train the YOLOv8 model, evaluate its performance, and test it on images and videos.
